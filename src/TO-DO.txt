IMPORTANT:
  add fields for equipped weapons, armor and shield to combat block
  combat block also needs CMD and CMB

NON-ESSENTIAL:
  update the state structure graph and export an image, so others can see it without special software (structure is still being changed, so any graph made now wouldn't reflect it correctly)
  change combat tables into arrays, so they can be initialized in a loop
  merge change combat block field functions in reducer
  add toggle detail button to all blocks
  add text field to some blocks for notes
